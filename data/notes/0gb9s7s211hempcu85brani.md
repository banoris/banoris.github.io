A semantic dyff tool for Yaml - <https://github.com/homeport/dyff>.

It's not a plain-text diff - so you don't need to reorder yaml keys between two files like you would normally do for plain-text diff. See screenshot: <https://github.com/homeport/dyff#use-cases-and-examples>

## Cheatsheet

```text
dyff between test1.yaml test2.yaml
```
